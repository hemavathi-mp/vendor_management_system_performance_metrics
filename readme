 Vendor Management System with Performance Metrics:

 Objective
 Develop a Vendor ManagementSystemusingDjangoandDjangoRESTFramework.This
 system will handle vendor profiles, track purchase orders, and calculate vendor performance
 metrics.

 Core Features

 1. Vendor Profile Management:
 ● ModelDesign:Createamodeltostorevendor information including name, contact
 details, address, and a unique vendor code.
 ● APIEndpoints:
 ● POST/api/vendors/: Create a new vendor.
 ● GET/api/vendors/: List all vendors.
 ● GET/api/vendors/{vendor_id}/: Retrieve a specific vendor's details.
 ● PUT/api/vendors/{vendor_id}/: Update a vendor's details.
 ● DELETE/api/vendors/{vendor_id}/: Delete a vendor.

 2. Purchase Order Tracking:
 ● ModelDesign:Trackpurchase orders with fields like PO number, vendor reference,
 order date, items, quantity, and status.
 ● APIEndpoints:
 ● POST/api/purchase_orders/: Create a purchase order.
 ● GET/api/purchase_orders/: List all purchase orders with an option to filter by
 vendor.
 ● GET/api/purchase_orders/{po_id}/: Retrieve details of a specific purchase order.
 ● PUT/api/purchase_orders/{po_id}/: Update a purchase order.
 ● DELETE/api/purchase_orders/{po_id}/: Delete a purchase order.

 3. Vendor Performance Evaluation:
 ● Metrics:
 ● On-TimeDeliveryRate: Percentage of orders delivered by the promised date.
 ● QualityRating: Average of quality ratings given to a vendor’s purchase orders.
 ● ResponseTime:Averagetimetakenbyavendortoacknowledgeorrespond to
 purchase orders.
 ● FulfilmentRate:Percentage of purchase orders fulfilled without issues.
 ● ModelDesign:Addfieldstothevendormodeltostorethese performance metrics.
 ● APIEndpoints:
 ● GET/api/vendors/{vendor_id}/performance: Retrieve a vendor's performance
 metrics.

Data Models:

 1. Vendor Model
 This model stores essential information about each vendor and their performance metrics.
 ● Fields:
 ● name:CharField-Vendor's name.
 ● contact_details: TextField- Contact information of the vendor.
 ● address:TextField- Physical address of the vendor.
 ● vendor_code:CharField- A unique identifier for the vendor.
 ● on_time_delivery_rate: FloatField- Tracks the percentage of on-time deliveries.
 ● quality_rating_avg: FloatField- Average rating of quality based on purchase
 orders.
 ● average_response_time: FloatField- Average time taken to acknowledge
 purchase orders.
 ● fulfillment_rate: FloatField- Percentage of purchase orders fulfilled successfully.

 2. Purchase Order (PO) Model
 This model captures the details of each purchase order and is used to calculate various
 performance metrics.
 ● Fields:
 ● po_number:CharField- Unique numberidentifying the PO.
 ● vendor:ForeignKey- Link to the Vendor model.
 ● order_date: DateTimeField- Date when the order was placed.
 ● delivery_date: DateTimeField- Expected or actual delivery date of the order.
 ● items:JSONField- Details of items ordered.
 ● quantity: IntegerField- Total quantity of items in the PO.
 ● status: CharField- Current status of the PO (e.g., pending, completed, canceled).
 ● quality_rating: FloatField- Rating given to the vendor for this PO (nullable).
 ● issue_date: DateTimeField- Timestamp when the PO was issued to the vendor.
 ● acknowledgment_date: DateTimeField, nullable- Timestamp when the vendor
 acknowledged the PO.

 3. Historical Performance Model
 This model optionally stores historical data on vendor performance, enabling trend analysis.
 ● Fields:
 ● vendor:ForeignKey- Link to the Vendor model.
 ● date:DateTimeField- Date of the performance record.
 ● on_time_delivery_rate: FloatField- Historical record of the on-time delivery rate.
 ● quality_rating_avg: FloatField- Historical record of the quality rating average.
 ● average_response_time: FloatField- Historical record of the average response
 time.
 ● fulfillment_rate: FloatField- Historical record of the fulfilment rate.
 These models form the backbone of the Vendor ManagementSystem, enabling
 comprehensive tracking and analysis of vendor performance over time. The performance
 metrics are updated based on interactions recorded in the Purchase Order model

Backend Logic:

 Backend Logic for Performance Metrics

 On-Time Delivery Rate:
 ● CalculatedeachtimeaPOstatuschangesto'completed'.
 ● Logic:CountthenumberofcompletedPOsdelivered onorbefore
 delivery_date and divide by the total number of completed POs for that vendor.

 Quality Rating Average:
 ● UpdateduponthecompletionofeachPOwhereaquality_rating is provided.
 ● Logic:Calculate the average of all quality_rating values for completed POs of
 the vendor.

 Average Response Time:
 ● CalculatedeachtimeaPOisacknowledgedbythevendor.
 ● Logic:Computethetimedifference between issue_date and
 acknowledgment_date for each PO, and then find the average of these times
 for all POs of the vendor.

 Fulfilment Rate:
 ● CalculateduponanychangeinPOstatus.
 ● Logic:Divide the numberofsuccessfully fulfilled POs (status 'completed'
 without issues) by the total number of POs issued to the vendor.

 API Endpoint Implementation
 ● VendorPerformanceEndpoint(GET/api/vendors/{vendor_id}/performance):
 ● Retrieves the calculated performance metrics for a specific vendor.
 ● Shouldreturndataincluding on_time_delivery_rate, quality_rating_avg,
 average_response_time,andfulfillment_rate.
 ● UpdateAcknowledgmentEndpoint:
 ● Whilenotexplicitly detailed in the previous sections, consider an endpoint like
 POST/api/purchase_orders/{po_id}/acknowledge for vendors to acknowledge
 POs.
 ● Thisendpointwill update acknowledgment_date and trigger the recalculation
 of average_response_time.

 Additional Technical Considerations
 ● EfficientCalculation: Ensure that the logic for calculating metrics is optimised to
 handle large datasets without significant performance issues.
 ● DataIntegrity: Include checks to handle scenarios like missing data points or division
 by zero in calculations.
 ● Real-timeUpdates: Consider using Django signals to trigger metric updates in
 real-timewhenrelatedPOdataismodified.
 Technical Requirements
 ● Usethelateststable version of Django and Django REST Framework.
 ● AdheretoRESTfulprinciples in API design.
 ● Implementcomprehensivedatavalidations for models.
 ● Utilise Django ORMfordatabase interactions.
 ● SecureAPIendpointswithtoken-based authentication.
 ● FollowPEP8styleguidelines for Python code.
 ● DocumenteachAPIendpointthoroughly.
